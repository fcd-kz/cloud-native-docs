##  Overview

The Virtual Machines service offers scalable compute instances to run your applications, services, and workloads. You can:

- Choose from predefined machine types (vCPU + RAM) or configure custom sizes  
- Use Linux or Windows images  
- Attach boot and data disks (SSD/HDD) with snapshot and image support  
- Connect via private and public networking (VPC, subnets, NAT, public IPs)  
- Define instance groups with autoscaling policies  
- Integrate with other Freedom Cloud services such as Object Storage, Managed Database and Kubernetes  

Explore the links above for detailed guidance on how to launch, manage and optimise your virtual machines.
