# Access management

Access to compute resources is controlled through Identity & Access Management (IAM) roles.

| Role                | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| compute.viewer      | Read-only access to VM instances            |
| compute.editor      | Create, modify, delete VM instances         |
| compute.admin       | Full control over the compute service       |

When granting permissions, follow the **least-privilege principle**: assign only the roles needed for a given task.
