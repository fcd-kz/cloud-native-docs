# Freedom Cloud Documentation

Welcome to the **Freedom Cloud Cloud Native Docs** repository. Here you can suggest improvements to our documentation or contribute directly — community input helps us evolve faster.

If you notice a typo, missing detail, or want to add a guide, create a **Pull Request**.  
For larger contributions, open an **Issue** first to describe your idea, and we’ll work with you to shape the content.

All documentation is written in **Markdown**. Contributions are reviewed, merged, and rewarded through our community program.
